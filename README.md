## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a junior React developer practicing modern component patterns and state management techniques as I work toward building clean, scalable, and maintainable front-end applications. This repository is a collection of projects and experiments that reflect my ongoing learning journey with React.

My focus is on mastering core React conceptsâ€”functional components, hooks, and propsâ€”while gradually moving into more advanced topics like custom hooks, context, and state management libraries. I'm also exploring reusable component patterns, such as compound components, controlled/uncontrolled components, and higher-order components to write more flexible and efficient UI code.

State management is another area I'm deeply invested in. Iâ€™m learning to manage both local and global state using tools like React Context, useReducer, and experimenting with third-party libraries like Redux and Zustand. Each project in this repo helps me better understand how to structure state logic and reduce complexity as apps grow.

These projects range from small, focused examples to more complete mini-appsâ€”such as task managers, form builders, modals, and dashboards. Iâ€™m using each of these as a practical opportunity to improve my understanding of component structure, data flow, and code reusability in real-world scenarios.

As I continue to grow, Iâ€™m working on writing cleaner code, breaking down components thoughtfully, and documenting my process to make collaboration easier. If you're also working with React or exploring similar topics, feel free to check out the projects, give feedback, or share ideasâ€”Iâ€™d love to connect and learn together.

Thanks for stopping byâ€”and hereâ€™s to building better React apps, one component at a time.
